I have created an ecommerce store named " Titan Lifestyle " using boot strap framework, HTML, CSS, and Javascript. It helps people to select and explore outfits that are in trend according to their daily style requirements. This smart and beautifully designed website has awesome features like banner text slider, eye-catching hover effects, smooth scrolling navigation, gallery light box effect, and much more. This website is a 100% responsive cross-browser template, compatible on all devices, and displayed on all screen sizes. This project is created both for sellers and customers as it has an attractive design to draw customer's attention and helps the seller to flex their best products. This way a customer can get any product at his/her doorstep without actually stepping out of home. I am using Microsoft Azure with Github to deploy the website and complete this project.
